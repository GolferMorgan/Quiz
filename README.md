# Quiz
This was a challenege where we were required to make a quiz that was built from javascript. 

## About the Assignment
In this project we were suppose to build a quiz using HTML, CSS, AND JAVASCRIPT. it was a difficult assignment and envolved a lot of work. The Javascript was particularly difficult and required more than normal relearning. I was able to create the quiz using just one HTML page instead of having to use multiple in order to get the questions to display correctly. The timer and the high scores page were extremely difficult and were left to last. A mistake in hindsight. Adding things to local storage was also difficult and left to the end.
